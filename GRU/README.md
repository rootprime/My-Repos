**Time Series Forecasting with GRU Neural Network**

This repository contains Python code for implementing a time series forecasting model using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The code is designed to analyze and predict trends in time series data, with applications in fields such as finance, economics, and environmental science.

**Key Features:**
- Data loading and preprocessing: Read and preprocess time series data from various sources, including Excel files and CSV files.
- GRU model architecture: Implement a deep learning model using GRU layers to capture temporal patterns and dependencies in the data.
- Training and evaluation: Train the GRU model on historical data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
- Prediction: Generate forecasts for future time steps based on the trained model, allowing for informed decision-making and trend analysis.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the GRU model on your own time series data.
4. Customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics as needed for your specific forecasting task.
