**Task 8: Create a table visual to represent the channel type and views per subscriber.**
- Create a table visual.
- Drag 'Channel Type' and 'Viewed by Subscriber' into the appropriate fields.

**Task 9: Create a measure to find total uploads and use the card visuals to represent the total uploads.**
- Create a new measure in Power BI with the formula: Total Uploads = SUM([Uploads]).
- Use the card visual to display the total uploads using this measure.

**Task 10: Create a decomposition tree to represent rank-wise categories.**
- Create a decomposition tree visual.
- Drag 'Category' and 'Rank' into the appropriate fields.

**Task 11: Create a blank navigation button to navigate between two pages.**
- Insert a blank button.
- Use the "Action" property to set a hyperlink or navigate to another page within the report.

**Task 12: Format your report by adding headings and logos.**

- Create a new dashboard.
- Drag and drop the key visuals (e.g., card visuals, radar chart, packed bubble chart) onto the dashboard.

**Task 15: From the Power BI Service, download the copy of your report in a pdf/ppt format.**
- Open your report in the Power BI Service.
- Click on "File" and choose "Export".
- Select the desired format (PDF or PPT) and download your report.

After completing these tasks, you'll have a comprehensive Power BI report with valuable insights from the YouTube dataset.
